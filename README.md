### 🏆 **Competitive Scoring System** (Updated October 2025)
```javascript
// NEW: Rewards perfect play with multipliers, flatter time curve
const baseScores = { easy: 1000, medium: 1500, hard: 5000 };
const targetTimes = { easy: 150, medium: 150, hard: 270 }; // 2:30, 2:30, 4:30

// Time scoring: max 1.5x (flatter curve encourages balanced play)
const timeMultiplier = actualTime <= targetTime ?
    1.0 + ((targetTime - actualTime) / targetTime) * 0.5 : // 1.0x to 1.5x
    timeRatio <= 2.0 ? 1.5 - (timeRatio * 0.5) :           // 1.0x to 0.5x
    0.5;                                                     // minimum 0.5x

let score = baseScore * timeMultiplier;

// Error penalty: HARSHER 15% per error (max 60%)
score *= (1 - Math.min(errors * 0.15, 0.60));

// Hint penalties: Level 1 = 0.5% each (encourages learning)
// Level 2/3 = Progressive 3-20% (breaks Perfect bonus)
if (level1HintsOnly) score *= (1 - level1Count * 0.005);
else if (hasLevel2Or3) score *= (1 - progressiveHintPenalty);

// 🎖️ PERFECT PLAY BONUSES (New!)
if (errors === 0 && hintsLevel1Only) score *= 1.35;  // ⭐ Perfect Strategy
if (errors === 0 && noHints) score *= 1.50;          // 🏆 Flawless Victory
```

- **Adjusted Targets**: Easy 2:30, Medium 2:30, Hard 4:30 (based on perfect play data)
- **Harsher Errors**: 15% per error (up from 12%) - makes first error very costly
- **Level 1 Hints Encouraged**: Only 0.5% penalty - promotes strategic learning
- **Strategic Depth**: Perfect play is now optimal strategy (hints for speed no longer worth it)
- **Score Ranges**: Easy 500-2250, Medium 750-3375, Hard 2500-11250 points

- Essential for testing new puzzle generation algorithms

### **Deployment**
The application is deployed on Vercel with:
- **Serverless Functions**: API endpoints for database operations
- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Supabase/Neon database for production data
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration management
- **Automatic Deployment**: Git-based deployment pipeline
- **Security Setup**: Automated user initialization with bcrypt password hashing

**Initial Deployment Steps:**
1. **Set Environment Variables** in Vercel dashboard:
   ```
   # Database
   POSTGRES_URL=your_database_connection_string

   # Legacy Auth (for Faidao & Filip)
   FAIDAO_PASSWORD=secure_password_for_faidao
   FILIP_PASSWORD=secure_password_for_filip

   # Clerk Authentication (Phase 0)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

   # PostHog Analytics (Phase 0)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=phc_...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://app.posthog.com

   # CRON Jobs
   CRON_SECRET=your_cron_secret_key
   ```

2. **Initialize Services**:
   ```bash
   # Database initialization (creates users table)
   npm run init-users

   # Vercel KV (Redis) setup - CRITICAL for caching (Phase 0)
   # 1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Storage → Create KV Database
   # 2. Link to your project (environment variables auto-added)
   # 3. Deploy - caching will be enabled automatically
   # Note: Caching gracefully degrades to no-cache in development

   # Clerk setup (configure in Clerk dashboard)
   # - Add allowed redirect URLs
   # - Configure session settings
   # - Set up OAuth providers (optional)

   # PostHog setup (configure in PostHog dashboard)
   # - Create project
   # - Enable feature flags (optional)
   # - Set up custom events
   ```

3. **Deploy**: Push to GitHub - Vercel automatically deploys

4. **Access**: Visit your Vercel URL
   - New users: Sign up via Clerk
   - Existing users (Faidao/Filip): Use legacy auth
   - Anonymous: Play immediately without signup

**Security Best Practices:**
- Never commit `.env.local` or `.env` files
- Rotate passwords quarterly
- Use strong passwords (16+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- Monitor access logs for suspicious activity
- Keep dependencies updated with `npm audit fix`
- Review SECURITY.md for comprehensive security guidelines
