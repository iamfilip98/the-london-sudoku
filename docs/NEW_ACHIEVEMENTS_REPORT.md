-- New tracking fields needed in user_stats
ALTER TABLE user_stats ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS variant_completions JSONB DEFAULT '{}';
ALTER TABLE user_stats ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS perfect_streaks JSONB DEFAULT '{}';
ALTER TABLE user_stats ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS error_free_streak INT DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE user_stats ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS personal_best_streak INT DEFAULT 0;
```
