### Step 4: Try Candidate Mode (1 minute)

**What is Candidate Mode?**
Candidate mode (also called "notes" or "pencil marks") lets you track possible numbers for cells.

**When to Use It:**
- **Easy puzzles**: Usually not needed
- **Medium puzzles**: Recommended
- **Hard puzzles**: Essential

**How to Use It:**
1. Press **Space** to enter candidate mode
2. Click cell
3. Press numbers **1-9** to add/remove candidates
4. Small numbers appear in cell
5. Press **Space** again to exit

**Example:**
```
Normal Mode:          Candidate Mode:
┌─────┐              ┌─────┐
│     │              │1 2 3│
│  7  │      →       │4   6│
│     │              │7 8 9│
└─────┘              └─────┘
```

**Why Use Candidates?**
- Track possibilities without guessing
- Eliminate options systematically
- Essential for Medium/Hard puzzles

**Pro Tip**: Fill candidates for all empty cells at the start of Medium/Hard puzzles!

### Step 5: Complete Your First Puzzle (3-10 minutes)

**Basic Strategy:**

**1. Look for Naked Singles** (easiest technique)
- Find cells with only one possible number
- Check what numbers are already in that row, column, and box
- If only one number fits, place it!

**Example:**
```
Row has: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
Column has: 1, 2, 5, 7, 8
Box has: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9

Empty cell can only be: 8 ✅
```

**2. Scan for Hidden Singles**
- Pick a number (e.g., 5)
- Look at a box—where can 5 go?
- If only one cell can hold 5, place it!

**3. Use Hints When Stuck**
- Press **H** or click "Hint" button
- A correct number is revealed
- Costs -5 points but gets you unstuck

**4. Don't Guess!**
- Use logic and elimination
- Guessing leads to errors (-10 points each)
- Take your time

**Visual Grid Layout:**
```
