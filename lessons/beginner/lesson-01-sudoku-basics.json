When you place a digit in a cell, it affects:\n- The entire row (no other cell in that row can have that digit)\n- The entire column (no other cell in that column can have that digit)\n- The entire box (no other cell in that box can have that digit)\n\n**Example:**\nIf you place a 5 in cell R1C1, then:\n- No other cell in Row 1 can be 5\n- No other cell in Column 1 can be 5\n- No other cell in Box 1 (top-left) can be 5",
