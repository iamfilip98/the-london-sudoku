      "title": "Strategy for Finding Naked Singles",
      "content": "There are two main approaches to finding naked singles efficiently:\n\n## **Approach 1: Full Cell Analysis**\n\nFor each empty cell:\n1. List all digits in its row\n2. List all digits in its column\n3. List all digits in its box\n4. Find the digit that's missing from all three\n\n**Pros:** Systematic and thorough\n**Cons:** Can be slow for complex puzzles\n\n## **Approach 2: Unit Scanning**\n\nFocus on rows, columns, or boxes that are nearly complete:\n1. Find a unit (row/column/box) with 8 filled cells\n2. The remaining cell must be the missing digit\n3. This is the fastest type of naked single!\n\n**Example of Unit Scanning:**\nIf Row 1 contains: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, _\nThen the empty cell **must be 8**\n\n## **Pro Tip: Combine Both Approaches**\n\n1. **Start with Unit Scanning** (quick wins)\n2. **Then do Cell Analysis** (thorough check)\n3. **After each placement**, check if new naked singles appear\n4. **Repeat** until no more naked singles exist\n\n## **Chain Reaction**\n\nNaked singles often create **more naked singles**:\n- Placing a digit eliminates it from 20 other cells\n- This elimination might create new naked singles\n- Keep scanning after each placement!\n\n**Example Chain:**\n1. Find naked single: R1C1 = 5\n2. This eliminates 5 from R1C5\n3. Now R1C5 only has one option left: 3\n4. This creates another naked single!\n\nThis **chain reaction** is why naked singles are so powerful.",

Watch for chain reactions after each placement\n\n**Tips:**\n- Start with boxes, rows, or columns that have 7-8 filled cells\n- After each placement, immediately check its neighbors\n- Don't rush - accuracy builds skill\n- Use hints if you get stuck\n\n**Goal:** Complete at least 3 of 4 puzzles",
