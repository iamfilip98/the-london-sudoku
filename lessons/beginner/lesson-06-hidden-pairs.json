      "content": "Welcome to Lesson 6 - the final lesson in the beginner course! You've learned naked pairs. Now learn their \"hidden\" counterpart: **Hidden Pairs**.\n\n**The Difference:**\n- **Naked Pairs**: Two cells with ONLY two candidates (easy to spot)\n- **Hidden Pairs**: Two cells where two digits are confined to those cells, but other candidates exist (hard to spot - \"hidden\")\n\n**What You'll Learn:**\n- What hidden pairs are and why they're \"hidden\"\n- How to find them by tracking digit placements\n- How to use them to eliminate candidates\n- The relationship between naked and hidden pairs\n\n**Why It's Important:**\nHidden pairs are often missed by beginners because they're not visually obvious. Learning to spot them will:\n- Unlock puzzles that seem stuck\n- Train your brain to think in multiple ways\n- Complete your fundamental pattern recognition skillset\n\n**Time Estimate:** 20 minutes",

      "title": "What Are Hidden Pairs?",
      "content": "A **hidden pair** occurs when two digits can ONLY go in two specific cells within a unit - but those cells also have other candidates, \"hiding\" the pair.\n\n## The Logic\n\n**Key Insight:**\nIf digits 3 and 7 can ONLY go in cells R4C2 and R4C6 within Row 4:\n- One cell will be 3, the other will be 7 (unknown which)\n- ALL other candidates in those two cells can be eliminated!\n- Those two cells form a \"hidden pair\"\n\n## Example\n\n**Look at Row 4:**\n- R4C2 has candidates: {2, 3, 7, 9}\n- R4C6 has candidates: {3, 5, 7, 8}\n- Other Row 4 cells have: various candidates, but none contain both 3 and 7\n\n**Analysis:**\nChecking where 3 can go in Row 4:\n- Only R4C2 and R4C6 can be 3\n\nChecking where 7 can go in Row 4:\n- Only R4C2 and R4C6 can be 7\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDigits {3, 7} are confined to cells {R4C2, R4C6} → Hidden pair!\n\n**Elimination:**\n- R4C2 had {2, 3, 7, 9} → Remove 2 and 9 → {3, 7}\n- R4C6 had {3, 5, 7, 8} → Remove 5 and 8 → {3, 7}\n\n**Result:** The hidden pair becomes a naked pair after elimination!\n\n## Why \"Hidden\"?\n\nThe pair is \"hidden\" because:\n1. The cells have multiple candidates (3-4 typically)\n2. You can't see it by looking at the cells\n3. You only discover it by tracking where specific DIGITS can go\n4. Once found, you eliminate the \"extra\" candidates\n\n## Hidden vs. Naked Pairs Comparison\n\n**Naked Pair {3, 7}:**\n```\nRow 4: ... [3,7] ... [3,7] ...\n           ↑         ↑\n        Obvious naked pair\n```\n- **Before**: Cells have ONLY {3, 7}\n- **Visible**: Yes, easy to spot\n- **Action**: Eliminate 3 and 7 from OTHER cells\n\n**Hidden Pair {3, 7}:**\n```\nRow 4: ... [2,3,7,9] ... [3,5,7,8] ...\n              ↑              ↑\n          Hidden pair - not obvious!\n```\n- **Before**: Cells have {2,3,7,9} and {3,5,7,8}\n- **Visible**: No, looks like random candidates\n- **Discovery**: Track where 3 and 7 can go → only these two cells\n- **Action**: Eliminate OTHER candidates (2,9,5,8) from THESE cells\n- **After**: Becomes naked pair {3,7}\n\n## The Fundamental Difference\n\n**Naked Pairs**: Eliminate FROM other cells\n**Hidden Pairs**: Eliminate FROM the pair cells themselves",

      "title": "How to Find Hidden Pairs",
      "content": "Finding hidden pairs requires systematic digit tracking. Here's the efficient method.\n\n## Step 1: Choose a Unit to Analyze\n\nPick a row, column, or box to scan. Good candidates:\n- Units with 5-6 filled cells (moderate number of empty cells)\n- Units where naked singles/pairs haven't helped\n\n## Step 2: List Missing Digits\n\nFor your chosen unit, identify which digits (1-9) are missing.\n\n**Example: Row 5**\nFilled: 1, 2, 5, 6, 9\nMissing: {3, 4, 7, 8}\n\n## Step 3: Track Each Missing Digit\n\nFor each missing digit, ask: \"Which empty cells can hold this digit?\"\n\nUse column and box constraints to eliminate impossible placements.\n\n**Tracking digit 3 in Row 5:**\n- R5C2: Can it be 3? Check Column 2 and Box 4\n- R5C4: Can it be 3? Check Column 4 and Box 5\n- R5C7: Can it be 3? Check Column 7 and Box 6\n- R5C8: Can it be 3? Check Column 8 and Box 6\n\n**Result**: Digit 3 can go in: {R5C2, R5C7}\n\nRepeat for all missing digits.\n\n## Step 4: Look for Pairs\n\nCheck if any TWO digits share the SAME TWO possible cells.\n\n**Example tracking results:**\n- Digit 3 can go in: {R5C2, R5C7}\n- Digit 4 can go in: {R5C4, R5C8}\n- Digit 7 can go in: {R5C2, R5C7} ← Same as 3!\n- Digit 8 can go in: {R5C4, R5C8, R5C9}\n\n**Hidden pair found!** Digits {3, 7} both confined to {R5C2, R5C7}\n\n## Step 5: Apply Elimination\n\nFor the two cells in the hidden pair:\n1. Keep ONLY the pair digits as candidates\n2. Remove ALL other candidates\n\n**Example:**\n- R5C2 had {3, 5, 7, 9} → Keep {3, 7} → Remove {5, 9}\n- R5C7 had {2, 3, 6, 7} → Keep {3, 7} → Remove {2, 6}\n\n## Systematic Scanning Strategy\n\n### **Priority 1: Boxes**\n\nBoxes are best for hidden pairs:\n1. Only 9 cells (less tracking)\n2. Usually 5-6 filled (ideal)\n3. Box constraints are easier to visualize\n\n**Process:**\n- Scan Box 1\n- List missing digits\n- Track where each can go\n- Look for two digits confined to two cells\n- Apply elimination if found\n- Repeat for all 9 boxes\n\n### **Priority 2: Rows**\n\n**Process:**\n- Pick a row with 5-6 filled cells\n- List missing digits\n- Track using column and box constraints\n- Look for pairs\n\n### **Priority 3: Columns**\n\nSame as rows, but vertical.\n\n## Pro Tips for Efficiency\n\n✅ **Focus on Units with 4-5 Empty Cells**\n- Too many empty cells (7-8) → too many possibilities\n- Too few empty cells (1-2) → no pairs possible\n- Sweet spot: 4-5 empty cells\n\n✅ **Track Digits with Limited Placements**\nIf a digit can go in 2-3 cells, it's a good candidate for a hidden pair.\n\nIf a digit can go in 5-6 cells, it's unlikely to form a hidden pair.\n\n✅ **Use Pencilmarks**\nWrite small numbers in cells to track possibilities:\n```\nR5C2: 3 5 7 9  ← After finding hidden pair {3,7}, cross out 5 and 9\n```\n\n✅ **Check After Naked Pairs**\nAfter finding and applying a naked pair, check for hidden pairs in the same unit. Elimination often reveals them!\n\n✅ **Look for Complementary Patterns**\nIf you find a hidden pair {3, 7} in cells {R5C2, R5C7}, this also means:\n- No other Row 5 cell can be 3 or 7\n- This is a naked pair property!\n\nHidden pairs and naked pairs are two views of the same constraint.\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### **Pattern 1: Box Hidden Pair**\n```\nBox 5 (center):\n[2,4,5] [6] [1]\n[9] [2,4,8] [3]\n[7] [8] [2,4,5]\n ↑          ↑\nDigits {2,4} confined to R4C4 and R5C7\n```\n\n### **Pattern 2: Row Hidden Pair**\n```\nRow 3: [5,6,9] [1] [5,9] [8] [5,6,9] [4] [2] [7] [3]\n        ↑              ↑       ↑\nDigits {6,9} confined to R3C1 and R3C5\n```\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n❌ **Forgetting Box Constraints**\nWhen tracking row placements, don't forget to check box constraints too!\n\n❌ **Looking at Cells Instead of Digits**\nHidden pairs require DIGIT tracking, not cell analysis.\n\n❌ **Eliminating from Wrong Cells**\nRemember: eliminate OTHER candidates FROM the pair cells, not the pair digits FROM other cells.\n\n❌ **Missing Partial Overlaps**\nSometimes three digits share partial overlaps:\n- Digit 3: cells {A, B}\n- Digit 7: cells {A, B} ← Hidden pair {3,7}\n- Digit 9: cells {A, B, C} ← Not part of pair\n\nDon't let extra overlaps confuse you!",

          "correct": 1,

          "explanation": "The fundamental difference is the approach: Naked pairs are found by looking at CELLS (two cells with same candidates are obvious). Hidden pairs are found by tracking DIGITS (where can each digit go?) - two digits confined to two cells. This requires different thinking: cell-focused vs. digit-focused!"
