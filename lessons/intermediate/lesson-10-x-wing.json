Learn **X-Wing** - one of the most powerful advanced patterns.\n\n**What You'll Learn:**\n- X-Wing pattern recognition (2x2 rectangle)\n- Row-based and column-based X-Wings\n- How to apply elimination\n\n**Why It's Important:**\nX-Wing solves puzzles that simpler techniques cannot. This pattern uses candidate constraints across multiple rows/columns simultaneously.\n\n**Time Estimate:** 30 minutes", "duration": 60},
