Learn **X-Sudoku** (also called Diagonal Sudoku).\n\n**What You'll Learn:**\n- X-Sudoku rules (diagonals constraint)\n- How diagonals add complexity\n- Solving strategies for X-Sudoku\n\n**New Rule:**\nBoth main diagonals must contain 1-9 (in addition to rows, columns, boxes).\n\n**Time Estimate:** 25 minutes", "duration": 60},

Each row contains 1-9\n2. Each column contains 1-9\n3.
